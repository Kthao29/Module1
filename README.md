# <Refactor Module 1>


## User Story

As a bootcamp student, I wanted to learn how to refactor codes by learning and understanding the common HTML semantic elements so I can make a neat and clean coding sheet.

 ## Acceptance Criteria

 Given the module 1 challenge code, 
 When I view the code, I know the HTML layout elements in the different sections
 It is done when I have a header, body, and footer section for the code.
 It is done when the CSS style sheet is in logical order
